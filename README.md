NOTE : IF you hate Friends, you can use this exact script to play a random episode of any of your favorite series! Happy Watching!

UPDATE 1:

NOW COMES WITH A BRAND NEW GUI!
Finally. Because of popular demand, I have added a Graphical Interface that lets you browse and point the script to your favorite series' folder location. Just click on Go and let the program pick an episode for you. Could it be any more simple?
